  <h1>H³ Budget Tool — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: September&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>H³ Budget Tool is designed to be a private, offline‑first budgeting application. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal or financial data to our servers. All information you enter into the app stays on your device unless you choose to export it.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All budgeting data, preferences, and settings are stored locally in your browser’s storage or on your device when installed from the Play Store. This means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No cloud sync or remote backups are performed by H³.</li>
    <li>You control when and how to export your data (e.g., CSV or PDF).</li>
    <li>Deleting browser storage or uninstalling the app will remove your data from that device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Play Store version may request limited permissions to enable optional features such as in‑app purchases. These permissions are used solely for their intended purpose and are never used to access unrelated data.</p>

  <h2>In‑App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Purchases in H³ Budget Tool are voluntary and do not unlock additional features. They exist solely to support the developer and keep the app ad‑free. Purchase processing is handled securely by Google Play; H³ does not receive or store your payment information.</p>

  <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>H³ Budget Tool does not integrate analytics, advertising networks, or tracking scripts. Links to external support platforms (e.g., CashApp, PayPal, Venmo) open in your browser and are subject to those services’ own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Export your data at any time.</li>
    <li>Delete your data by clearing browser storage or uninstalling the app.</li>
    <li>Use the app entirely offline without loss of functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date above and publish the revised version at this URL.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the support links provided in the app.</p>
